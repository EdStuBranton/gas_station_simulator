# gas_station_simulator

The plan:
- program a fully functional gas station with pumps, different Fuel types, gas storage tanks, revenue, expenses, and Employee salaries
- It has to be written in Java OOP, no visuals
- The idea is to go through the entire process of Planning/coding/debugging/release
- It's also going to be a learning project due to me never writing anything in Java before. I did however learn the basics in Python
so translating that knowledge into Java Syntax is going to be name of the challenge.
